## Description

This repository contains all of the data and code needed to replicate the analysis part of this project. More info about the project can be found in the wiki.

## Wiki

The project's wiki can be found [here](https://git.sbg.ac.at/st22_512323/i3-project-st23-dawuda/-/wikis/Deep-learning-based-road-segmentation-using-aerial-imagery-for-automated-change-detection). It provides more in-depth information about the project and its status.

## Run the Analysis

All analysis steps in Python can be found in a Jupyter Notebook: [Current code (WIP)](https://git.sbg.ac.at/st22_512323/i3-project-st23-dawuda/-/blob/main/code/RChan_180423.ipynb)

Google Colab is recommended to execute the code. To perform the analysis, the notebook needs access to a Google Drive account hosting the imagery: [Current datasets (WIP)](https://git.sbg.ac.at/st22_512323/i3-project-st23-dawuda/-/tree/main/data)

To use the final model for making segmentations, the pretrained model with saved weights can be loaded.<mark> link once complete </mark>. To do this, skip all training steps and run the following block<mark> image once complete </mark>. In case you want to re-train the model the training data must also be hosted on Google Drive.
